I am a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, specializing in Mars geology, astrobiology, and the application of artificial intelligence to planetary exploration. My research focuses on understanding the ancient history of Mars through orbital remote sensing, with particular emphasis on crustal composition, hydrothermal systems, and the search for biosignatures.

## Research Focus

My work sits at the intersection of planetary geology, remote sensing, and data science. I use hyperspectral imaging data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to investigate the mineralogical and geochemical composition of Mars' ancient crust, seeking to understand the planet's early differentiation, aqueous alteration history, and potential for past habitability.

### Key Research Areas

**Ancient Martian Crust & Planetary Evolution**
I investigate the composition and evolution of Mars' oldest terrains, including the recent discovery of widespread anorthosites in the planet's lower crust. This work provides fundamental insights into early planetary differentiation processes and the geological evolution of terrestrial planets.

**Mars Astrobiology & Biosignature Detection**
I develop and apply AI/machine learning techniques to improve the detection of potential biosignatures and identify high-priority targets for astrobiology investigations. My work addresses critical knowledge gaps in understanding Mars' habitability through time.

**Hydrothermal Systems & Aqueous Alteration**
My research characterizes ancient hydrothermal environments in Martian impact basins, investigating mineral assemblages that record past water-rock interactions and their implications for habitability and preservation of biosignatures.

**Hyperspectral Data Processing & Analysis**
I develop computational tools and processing pipelines for analyzing CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) hyperspectral data, including automated detection algorithms and spectral analysis frameworks that enable large-scale compositional mapping.

## Current Work

I am actively involved in Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission support, Mars Sample Return planning, and the development of AI-driven approaches for autonomous science operations in planetary exploration. My work combines orbital remote sensing observations with terrestrial analog studies to better understand Mars' geological history and astrobiological potential.

## Approach

My research is fundamentally interdisciplinary, integrating planetary geology, remote sensing, data science, and field work. I combine detailed spectral analysis of Martian surfaces with terrestrial analog studies in extreme environments, developing computational tools that advance both our scientific understanding and our technical capabilities for planetary exploration.
