I am a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, specializing in Mars geology, astrobiology, and the application of artificial intelligence to planetary exploration. My research focuses on understanding the ancient history of Mars through orbital remote sensing, with particular emphasis on crustal composition, hydrothermal systems, and the search for biosignatures.

## Research Focus

My work sits at the intersection of planetary geology, remote sensing, and data science. I use hyperspectral imaging data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to investigate the mineralogical and geochemical composition of Mars' ancient crust, seeking to understand the planet's early differentiation, aqueous alteration history, and potential for past habitability.

### Key Research Areas

**Ancient Martian Crust & Planetary Evolution**
I investigate the composition and evolution of Mars' oldest terrains, including the recent discovery of widespread anorthosites in the planet's lower crust. This work provides fundamental insights into early planetary differentiation processes and the geological evolution of terrestrial planets.

**Mars Astrobiology & Biosignature Detection**
I develop and apply AI/machine learning techniques to improve the detection of potential biosignatures and identify high-priority targets for astrobiology investigations. My work addresses critical knowledge gaps in understanding Mars' habitability through time.

**Hydrothermal Systems & Aqueous Alteration**
My research characterizes ancient hydrothermal environments in Martian impact basins, investigating mineral assemblages that record past water-rock interactions and their implications for habitability and preservation of biosignatures.

**Hyperspectral Data Processing & Analysis**
I develop computational tools and processing pipelines for analyzing CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) hyperspectral data, including automated detection algorithms and spectral analysis frameworks that enable large-scale compositional mapping.

## Current Work

I currently lead and contribute to multiple NASA-funded research projects investigating Mars through orbital remote sensing and data analysis. My active projects include:

- **From Olivine to Feldspar: Tracing Martian Crustal Evolution with CRISM Mapping Data** (PI) - Using CRISM hyperspectral data to map and understand the compositional evolution of Mars' ancient crust.

- **Spectral Cube Analysis Tool** (PI) - Developing a Python-based graphical user interface for analyzing hyperspectral imaging data from planetary missions.

- **Production of Digital Terrain Models from HiRISE Stereo Pairs** (PI) - Creating high-resolution topographic data products from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter imagery.

- **Geologic Context of Unique Basin-Related Alteration Environments** (Co-I, Johns Hopkins University) - Characterizing ancient aqueous alteration in Martian impact basins and their astrobiological implications.

- **Spectral and Geologic Analyses of Light-Toned Units in Southern Sinus Meridiani** (Co-I, SUNY) - Investigating sedimentary and altered outcrops in equatorial Mars regions.

- **Planetary Data Training Workshops** (Team Member, Arizona State University) - Training the next generation of planetary scientists in data analysis techniques.

My research combines detailed spectral analysis of Mars' surface with computational tool development and terrestrial analog studies to advance our understanding of the planet's geological history and astrobiological potential.

## Approach

My research is fundamentally interdisciplinary, integrating planetary geology, remote sensing, data science, and field work. I combine detailed spectral analysis of Martian surfaces with terrestrial analog studies in extreme environments, developing computational tools that advance both our scientific understanding and our technical capabilities for planetary exploration.
