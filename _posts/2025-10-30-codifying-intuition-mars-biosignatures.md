I recently published an article in the [Nature Communities](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/codifying-intuition-in-the-search-for-life) discussing how we can move beyond intuition-driven approaches to systematically search for signs of life on Mars.

## The Challenge

Current Mars rovers lack a strategic roadmap for locating biosignatures within habitable environments. Unlike orbital missions that can leverage vast datasets across an entire planet, rover teams must make targeted decisions about where to explore. This is where intuition has traditionally guided exploration decisions—but intuition is inherently subjective and difficult to standardize.

## Our Approach

We developed a repeatable, data-driven methodology that combines:
- **Geological knowledge** of Mars-analog environments
- **Statistical ecology** to understand microbial distribution patterns
- **Machine learning** (convolutional neural networks) to create "biosignature probability maps"

Testing this framework at Salar de Pajonales in the Andes—a terrestrial site that mimics early Mars conditions—we demonstrated that we can systematically identify high-probability targets for discovering microbial life signatures.

## Why This Matters

By building a library of "biosignature roadmaps" from multiple Mars-analog sites, we can identify universal patterns that apply to extreme environments. This transforms astrobiology from an intuition-based discipline into a standardized, comparable, and scientifically validated search strategy.
