## About the Article

"Where to Find Biosignatures on Mars: A Case for Clays" explores the importance of clay minerals in the search for signs of past life on Mars. Clay minerals are particularly significant because they form in neutral pH, aqueous environmentsâ€”conditions that would have been hospitable to microbial life in Mars' ancient past.

This article breaks down why clay-rich regions on Mars should be priority targets for future rover missions searching for biosignatures, and how spectroscopic data from orbital instruments can help identify these promising locations.
