## Course Overview

Upper-level undergraduate course examining physical and chemical processes that shape planetary surfaces. The course emphasizes understanding surface evolution through the lens of planetary geology, climate systems, and environmental change.

## Topics Covered

- Planetary atmospheres and climate systems
- Weathering and erosion processes
- Fluvial and aeolian processes on planetary surfaces
- Volcanism and igneous processes
- Impact cratering and planetary impacts
- Glacial and periglacial processes
- Habitability and planetary surface-atmosphere interactions
- Case studies from Mars, Venus, Earth, and other planetary bodies

## Course Approach

The course integrates field observations, laboratory experiments, and analysis of planetary data to understand surface processes. Students learn to interpret planetary imagery, construct geological models, and evaluate evidence for past processes.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will:
- Understand physical processes shaping planetary surfaces
- Apply Earth-based geology to planetary contexts
- Analyze planetary imagery and datasets
- Interpret geological evidence for past environmental conditions
- Evaluate habitability of planetary environments
